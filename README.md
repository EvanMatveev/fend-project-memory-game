# Memory Game Project

## About the project

This is the third project on the Udacity FEND track. The task was to code a Memory Game and manage all interactions that a user can experience. The game has a timer, a star rating (base on how many attempts a player makes).

## Gameplay

Your task is to find all 8 matches from 16 cards. There are 8 pairs of different currencies that many people around the world use. When the cards are matches - they stay opened on the board. You will get your own score based on how many attempts you make before finishing the game. You will also get the timer to guide you throughout your journey.
